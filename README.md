## Synopsis

This repository contains code used in Lesson 7 - Chapter 13 of Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree (Term 1).

## Goal

The goal of the quiz is to define the backword method in Miniflow (a very basic version of TensorFlow) in the Sigmoid class.

## Expected Results

The expected output is:

`
[array([[ -3.34017280e-05,  -5.01025919e-05],
       [ -6.68040138e-05,  -1.00206021e-04]]), array([[ 0.9999833],
       [ 1.9999833]]), array([[  5.01028709e-05],
       [  1.00205742e-04]]), array([ -5.01028709e-05])]
